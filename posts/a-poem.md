So today I wrote the poem. For the record, I don't think the weather sucks. Artistic license.

    <!-- language: lang-none -->

    Pretty average is pretty good.

    I went to the gym today
    and did some cleans.

    Last week I pulled 80 kg which
    I thought
    was pretty great
    but in many places
    the 15 kg plates are bigger than the tens

    So I thought I'd do 90 kg today.

    And so I did, but pulled some back muscle
    as well

    Understandably I was pretty pissed. <---------|
                                                  |
    and this guy next to me was doing deadlift    |
    singles                                       |
    with 180                                      |
    185                                           |
    or so.                                        |
    taking                                        |
    l o n g                                       |
    5 minute                                      |
                                                  |
    pauses                                        |
                                                  |
    like pulling a fucking world record.          |
                                                  |
    So I decided to take it out on deadlifts. ----|

    I pulled 100, 140, 150, 160 kg
    with no rest, just taking the time to add the plates.

    Then I rested for a minute, and did 170 kg.
    Personal best since 2009.

    I thought about doing 180 but decided against it,
    because I plan on working out every day
    until I leave to Asia. To fuck.

    So all in all, I'd rate the day as

    4/5

    Didn't get laid and the weather sucks.
